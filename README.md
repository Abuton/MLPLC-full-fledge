# pima-indians-MLPLC-full-fledge
This repo contain a notebook, pdf format and dataset of pima indians on diabetes 
i want to start a new project and i will be implementing the entire process of ML model which are <br>
1. Getting the data
2. Data Cleaning and Formatting
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Feature Enginerring and Feature Selection
5. Establish a Baseline and compare several ML models on a performance metric
6. Choose Best Model on a performance metric and perform Hyperparameter tuning
7. Evaluate the best model on the test set
8. Interpret the model result
9. Draw conclusion and write a well documented report
0. Make **Money** hopefully soon

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. <br>

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on. <br>

## Inspiration
Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

The result of this model is being worked on. An interactive web app will be built to allow users to easily see the results of the model.
